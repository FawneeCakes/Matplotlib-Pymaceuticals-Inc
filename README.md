# Matplotlib-Pymaceuticals-Inc

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

In this assignment, you’ll apply what you've learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.

Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Analysis

The Capomulin and Ramicane drug regimens were the most effective in reducing tumor volume in mice. Infubinol and Ceftamin regimens had larger average final tumor volumes and greater tumor volume variance. A strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.84) was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen. The linear regression plot confirmed that as mouse weight increased, average tumor volume also increased. Controlling for mouse weight is crucial when interpreting preclinical study resultsAdd your analysis here.

I am unable to figure out why my correlation and regression coding is not wokring.
